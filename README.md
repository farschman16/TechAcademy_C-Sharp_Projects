### Newsletter App

* This project is a datbase-first Entity Framework MVC application that mimics an online sign-up for a newsletter. This application included an admin page that gave the administrator the ability to view all current subscribers as well as option to unsubscribe a user of their choosing.

### TwentyOne Game

This project is a console application that utilized the .NET Framework. This application functioned as a blackjack game within the console, complete with users, a dealer with full functionality, a randomized (shuffled) card deck for each instance (hand) of the game, and exception handling for a player attempting to cheat the game.

### Car Insurance App

This project is a database-first MVC application that utilizes .NET Core, Entity Framework, Bootstrap, and Razor syntax. The app allows the user to input their information including age, car year/make/model to be insured, number of speeding tickets and DUIs, and would perform business logic to calculate an insurance estimate. All this information was then stored on a database and could be queried.
This app also featured an admin page where the administrator could view all insurees who have applied.
